Classify the user's intent into one of:

1. new_complaint — The user is reporting a new complaint, such as an incident or violation.
2. follow_up_complaint — The user is adding more details or evidence related to a complaint already reported.
3. law_policy_query — The user is asking about laws, penalties, or rules related to a crime or complaint.
4. complaint_details — The user is asking for specific information about a complaint, such as status, suspect, officer, date, or ID. This also includes queries about individuals who might be related to a complaint (e.g., a suspect, a witness, an officer).
5. user_friendly — The user is making casual conversation or greeting (e.g. "Hi", "How are you?", "Thanks", etc).

Only use the most fitting intent. If the query is unclear, treat it as `user_friendly`.

Intent: <intent>
